Assignment: P2 Census Visualization

Description:
Takes data for the 2021 Health Census in Monroe, NY and Fulton County, 
Georgia and displays different aspects of it. Has user controls to 
change the county displayed and filter which tracts are displayed

User Responsibilities:
The user must scroll to the bottom of the canvas to see the controls.
Then use them to either change the county displayed 
or filter the displayed tracts. 

Issues/Caveats: 
For the variables that are represented by color is it hard to tell what it varying ranges
 and I'm not sure how to fix it
